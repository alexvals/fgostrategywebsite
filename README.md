# Class project

I have made a website with three strategies for clearing the bulk of the FGO mobile game storyline.
I have added a contact page, about section, home page, and a gallery.
The gallery is useful for showing the different evolved forms of the FGO characters I mention on my strategy page.
Slight lag can occur when using the gallery due to GitHub hosting. There is little to no lag when running the files locally.
